0-5. 
Is this a valid program? Why or why not?

#include <iostream>
int main() std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;

A 
No. C++ needs brackets around any statement inside a function. Running this would get 
error: expected initializer before ‘std’

0-6. 
Is this a valid program? Why or why not?

#include <iostream>
int main() {{{{{{ std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl; }}}}}}

A
Yes. This version of the code has brackets. Actually 6 pairs of brackets and that is totally functional even though super messy way to write code.

0-7
Check the exercise from the book as it cannot be written here as it uses these /* free-from comments the wrong way. 

0-8
This excerise snippet cancels out my last free-form comment mark, so it cannot be copied. It is valid code though.
